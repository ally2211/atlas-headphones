## Building a Web Page the Right Way
Some guidelines we implemented to ensure your web page is well-structured and maintainable.

## Foundations

1. **Use Variables**
   - Define variables for colors, fonts, and other reusable styles to maintain consistency and make updates easier.

2. **Simple/“As Generic As You Can” CSS Selectors**
   - Use generic selectors to keep your CSS maintainable and avoid specificity issues.

3. **Avoid Using Super Specific CSS Selectors**
   - Keep your CSS selectors simple to reduce complexity and improve readability.

4. **Simple HTML Structure**
   - Use section containers to divide the pages
   -  Use div containers in every section to organize your content and keep the structure clean and easy to follow.

6. **Building Strategy**
   - Build the web page one section at a time and use variables for colors for consistency.  Start by building the HTML page and then add the css for each section.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create the Header/Hero Piece
- Build the header or hero section as the first task.
- Ensure it is visually appealing and sets the tone for the rest of the web page.

### Task 2: Create the "What we do…" Section
- Build the section that describes what the business does.
- Use custom font icons provided in the `holberton_school-icon.zip` archive.

### Task 3: Create the "Our Results" Section
- Showcase the results or achievements of the business.
- Reuse components from the "What we do…" section to maintain consistency.
- Do an overlay showing percentage of business improvement indicators.

### Task 4: Contact Form
- A good landing page always includes a contact form.
- We capture the name, the email and allow user to leave a comment
- We have a button to "Call to Action"

### Task 5: Footer
- Complete the web page with a footer section.
- Ensure it includes necessary links and information, maintaining the overall design consistency.
